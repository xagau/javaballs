Bouncing Java Balls made with Java

This is a very simple application written by Sean Beecroft. This application demonstrates Threads, Timers, graphics painting among other things. It demonstrates how one can use collections. Subsequently this application also demonstrates some basic Newtonian physics. This application is inspired by PHUN. Friction is incomplete.

To run the application run the jar file.

You can add balls to the application by clicking the mouse.

Sort of a silly application but it may be of use to someone.
